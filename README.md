## Description
The following is a guide to use this repository. All the scripts are in ".m" format (MATLAB script files). 

The folders are summarized below (click on the relevant Section to get more information):
<details>
  <summary> <b> Main </b> </summary>
  
  This folder is about the problem of non-convex maximization over a simplex. Here, the objective function can be written as f + g where f is the norm of a linear transformation (that is obtained by random sampling) of the decision vector and g is a concave barrier function. In other words, this folder is dedicated to Section 3 of the paper where the objective function is visualized in Figure 1.
  
  The function ```optim.m``` takes an input ```n``` and generates an example problem randomly by sampling a random diagonal matrix and a random uniform rotation matrix (see reference [18]). The problem data is stored by saving ```D``` and ```Q``` where the notation is analogous to the paper's notation. Then, the function solves the RLT relaxation and saves the results as ```rlt``` where ```rlt[1]``` gives the corresponding upper bound and ```rlt[2]``` gives the time it took for the solver (MOSEK) to solve this relaxation. Afterwards, the function solves the RLT/SDP relaxation simply by adding an LMI constraint, and saves the solution as ```rltsdp``` where similarly ```rltsdp[1]``` gives the corresponding upper bound and ```rltsdp[2]``` gives thte time it took for the solver (MOSEK) to solve this relaxation. Finally, the function solves the proposed relaxation in our paper (simply by substituting the matrix variable with its analytical solution and rewritig expressions), and saves the solution as ```our``` where similarly ```our[1]``` gives the corresponding upper bound and ```our[2]``` gives the time it took for the solver (MOSEK). As we prove in our work, ```rlt[1] = rltsdp[1] = our[1]``` holds for all instances, however we typically have ```our[2] << rlt[2] << rltsdp[2]```.
  
  In Figure 2 of Section 3, we compare the median of ```our[2]```, ```rlt[2]```, and ```rltsdp[2]``` for 25 randomly generated instances, for all `n` varying between 10 and 1000.

  <summary> <b> Non-convex hypercubic optimization </b> </summary>
  
  This folder is about the problem of non-convex maximization over a hypercube. Here, the objective function is almost identical with the one in ```Main/optim.m```, with the only difference being we do not subtract a vector of 1/n's from the decision vector (since the feasible region is not a simplex anymore). In other words, this folder is dedicated to the **first** problem in Appendix Section B.1 of the paper.
  
  The function ```optim.m``` takes inputs ```n``` and ```rhs``` where in the paper we always take ```rhs = 1``` (i.e., we have a unit hypercube). The function then generates an example problem randomly similarly as in ```Main/optim.m```. The problem data is stored by saving ```D``` and ```Q``` where the notation is analogous to the paper's notation. Then, by using MOSEK solver, the function obtains the traditional RLT relaxation, the RLT/SDP relaxation, and the relaxation we propose, and saves these as ```rlt```, ```rltsdp```, and ```our```, respectively. As before, `rlt[1]` corresponds to the relaxation of the RLT relaxation, and `rlt[2]` corresponds to the solver time (same as `rltsdp` and `our`). As the original problem is not defined over a simplex, we do not have `rlt[1] = rltsdp[1]` anymore. However, as we proved in Theorem 3, we always have ```our[1] <= rltsdp[1] <= rlt[1]```, and our numerical experiments show that we have ```our[1] < rltsdp[1] < rlt[1]``` in general. Finally, our method uses exponentially many variables to reformulate the problem as a non-convex optimization problem over a simplex, hence the runtime of our method will depend on `n`, while we always have `rlt[2] <= rltsdp[2]` by definition. 
  
  In Figure 3 of Section B.1, we compare the median of solution times ```our[2]```, ```rlt[2]```, and ```rltsdp[2]``` as well as the median deviation of ```rlt[1]``` and ```rltsdp[1]``` from ```our[1]``` for 25 randomly generated instances, for all `n` varying between 2 and 10.

  <summary> <b> Non-convex over cube and simplex </b> </summary>
  
  This folder is about the problem of non-convex maximization over the cartesian product of a hypercube (of size `k`, this vector is called `y`) and a simplex (of size `n - k`, this vector is called `x`). Here, the objective function is a combination of the ones in ```Main/optim.m``` and ```Non-convex hypercubic optimization/optim.m```, namely the convex function f similarly is the norm of a linear transofmraion of the input, however 1/(n-k) is being subtracted from the components of `x`, as well as, the logarithmic barrier function slightly varies between `x` and `y` as their extreme points are different. This folder is dedicated to the **second** problem in Appendix Section B.1 of the paper.
  
  The function ```optim.m``` takes inputs ```n``` and `k`, where in the paper we always take ```k = 3``` (i.e., the hypercube is three dimensional). The function then generates an example problem randomly similarly as in ```Main/optim.m```. The problem data is stored by saving ```D``` and ```Q``` where the notation is analogous to the paper's notation. Then, by using MOSEK solver, the function obtains the traditional RLT relaxation, the RLT/SDP relaxation, and the relaxation we propose, and saves these as ```rlt```, ```rltsdp```, and ```our```, respectively. Here, our implementation does not define `x` and `y` separately, we rather keep only one vector `x` of size `n`, hence define some additional matrices (`TX`, `TY`, `MX`, `MY`) to be able to compactly define the relaxation problems (e.g., `TX * x` extracts the original `x` and `TY * x` extracts the original `y`). As before, `rlt[1]` corresponds to the relaxation of the RLT relaxation, and `rlt[2]` corresponds to the solver time (same as `rltsdp` and `our`). As the original problem is not defined over a simplex, we do not have `rlt[1] = rltsdp[1]` anymore. However, as we proved in Theorem 3, we always have ```our[1] <= rltsdp[1] <= rlt[1]```, and our numerical experiments show that we have ```our[1] < rltsdp[1] < rlt[1]``` in general. Finally, although our method uses exponentially many variables to reformulate the `y` variable, as `k` is fixed, the proposed relaxation is very fast for larger `n` values and it also outperforms the traditional RLT and RLT/SDP relaxations in terms of the runtimes.
  
  In Figure 4 of Section B.1, we compare the median of solution times ```our[2]```, ```rlt[2]```, and ```rltsdp[2]``` for 25 randomly generated instances, for all `n` varying between 10 and 1000.
