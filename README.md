Data and codes of the paper _A Reformulation-Linearization Technique for Optimization over Simplices_ by _Aras Selvi, Dick den Hertog, and Wolfram Wiesemann (2021)_.

The preprint (version of 8 May 2021) is available on [Optimization Online](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2020/11/8098.pdf). The paper is presented at [OR63](https://www.theorsociety.com/events/annual-conference/).

Update: On 13 September 2021, this paper is accepted for a publication in _Mathematical Programming_. 

## Introduction
This repository provides the following:
- TBA

## Final Notes
The following scripts are also available upon request:
- Global optimization of the original convex maximization problems via global optimization solvers
- Our simulation codes where we iteratively call the optimization functions provided here to randomly generate problems, solve them, save the solutions, and plot the results.
